        Mental health challenges in Bangladesh remain unmet due to lack of
        awareness and shortage of mental health professionals, according to
        experts. According to a 2018 survey on mental health jointly conducted
        by the government and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),
        the overall prevalence of mental disorders among the population 18 years
        and above was 18.7%. Prevalence of disorders was highest among those 60
        years and older at 20.2%. An estimated 10,000 people die by suicide in
        Bangladesh on average each year, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of
        Statistics. A study published last month found that 14,436 people in
        Bangladesh had taken their own life since March 2020, 70% more than
        coronavirus claimed during that period. The study said 49% of suicide
        victims were between 20 and 35 years of age. “We recently provided
        mental health support to some 11,000 people mostly women and adolescents
        at the community level during the pandemic,” Rifat Sharmin, a clinical
        psychologist at the Community empowerment program of BRAC, a
        non-government group, told Anadolu Agency. “We learnt from the field
        experience that it still remains a stigma and taboo especially in rural
        Bangladesh. And it is also a tough job to provide support to patients.”
        She said the group faced immense discomfort and non-cooperation from
        victims’ family and the public. “They don’t want to share their personal
        issue of distressed and mental problems fearing to be stigmatized in
        society, whereas community leaders also create barriers,” she said. “If
        we don’t provide proper mental health treatment and support during
        childhood then it would become difficult in adulthood for patients.”
